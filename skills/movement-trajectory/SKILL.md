# Movement & Trajectory Analytics

Purpose: turn noisy timestamped points into defensible movement facts. The
recurring failure modes: **speed computed through GPS noise** (teleporting
points → 400 km/h pedestrians), **stops invented by signal drift**, and
**privacy-blind delivery** of individual-level traces.

## Data model first

A trajectory = ordered fixes per object: `(object_id, timestamp, x, y,
[accuracy, ...])`. Before analysis, report per object: fix count, time
span, median sampling interval, and interval distribution — **sampling
rate drives every method choice** (1 s vehicle traces and 1 fix/hour
animal tags are different problems wearing the same schema).

```python
import movingpandas as mpd
import geopandas as gpd

gdf = gpd.GeoDataFrame(df, geometry=gpd.points_from_xy(df.lon, df.lat),
                       crs=4326).to_crs(gdf_utm_epsg)
tc = mpd.TrajectoryCollection(gdf, "object_id", t="timestamp")
```

Work in a projected CRS for all speed/distance computation; keep
timestamps timezone-aware UTC (mixed local times create midnight
teleports).

## Cleaning pipeline (in order)

1. **Deduplicate** identical (object, timestamp) fixes.
2. **Accuracy filter**: drop fixes above an HDOP/accuracy threshold if
   the column exists (report the threshold and % dropped).
3. **Speed filter**: drop fixes implying impossible speed for the mode
   (walk > 15 km/h sustained, car > 200 km/h...); iterate — one bad fix
   creates two bad segments (`mpd.OutlierCleaner`).
4. **Gap splitting**: split trajectories at temporal gaps (e.g., > 5×
   median interval) — interpolating across a tunnel/power-off invents
   movement.
5. Optional smoothing (Kalman/rolling median) for jittery urban-canyon
   data — AFTER outlier removal, and never before stop detection tuning.

Accounting line per step: fixes in → out.

## Stops and trips

Stop = spatial dwell: fixes within a distance radius for a minimum
duration (`mpd.TrajectoryStopDetector(max_diameter=50,
min_duration=timedelta(minutes=5))`). The two parameters ARE the result —
report them and run a ±50% sensitivity check; urban-canyon drift mimics
movement, so diameter < GPS noise level yields zero stops.

Trips = segments between stops. Deliver per trip: origin, destination,
start/end time, duration, length, main mode guess if applicable. OD
matrices: aggregate trip endpoints to zones (see privacy below);
accessibility questions on the resulting flows → `network-accessibility-analysis`.

## Map matching

Raw GPS does not sit on the road. For any road-referenced claim (distance
driven, street-level flows, speeding), match to the network first:

- Tools: Valhalla (Meili), OSRM `match`, or `mappymatch`; HMM-based
  matchers are the standard.
- Sampling interval > ~30 s degrades matching sharply — report match
  confidence and the % of unmatched points; don't silently keep unmatched
  geometry.
- Never map-match animal tracks or off-road movement (obviously) — and
  don't compute "distance traveled" from raw noisy fixes either
  (noise inflates path length ~5-20%); smooth first, state the method.

## Aggregate analytics

- **Flow maps / desire lines**: aggregate OD pairs before plotting
  (`cartography-geoviz` for delivery); hairball avoidance = zone-level
  aggregation + minimum-flow threshold.
- **Density**: KDE or hex-bin of fixes vs of trips — fixes overweight slow
  movement (dwell = many fixes); use trip-based or time-weighted density
  and say which.
- **Space-time clustering** (co-location, convoys): ST-DBSCAN family;
  cluster parameters in both space and time reported together.
- Sequence/periodicity: hour-of-day × day-of-week activity matrices per
  object class before any behavioral claims.

## Privacy — non-optional

Individual trajectories are personal data almost everywhere (GDPR etc.)
and are notoriously re-identifiable (home/work anchor pairs identify most
people). Defaults: aggregate before sharing (zones ≥ k objects,
suppress cells < k, typical k=5-10), truncate trip ends near homes,
and never publish raw individual traces without explicit clearance.
State the anonymization applied in every deliverable.

## Verification protocol

1. Speed histogram per mode after cleaning — tail must be physically
   plausible.
2. Map 3 sample trajectories (raw vs cleaned vs matched) over a basemap.
3. Stop-detection sensitivity: parameters ±50%, report stop-count change.
4. OD totals reconcile with trip counts (accounting).

## Pitfalls checklist

- Speeds computed across gaps or through outlier fixes.
- Distance traveled from raw (unsmoothed, unmatched) fixes.
- Stops detected with radius below GPS noise, or drift counted as trips.
- Mixed timezones / DST jumps creating phantom teleports.
- Fix-density maps read as movement-density maps.
- Individual traces shipped without aggregation/suppression.
- Trajectories split by object but not by temporal gap.

## Execution contract

- **Workflow:** validate identifiers, time, and CRS; segment tracks; remove impossible fixes; infer stops or trips; optionally map-match; aggregate; apply privacy controls; verify.
- **Decision rules:** use trajectory methods for observed timestamped movement, network analysis for possible routes or access, and point-pattern methods when sequence and identity are absent.
- **Verification protocol:** inspect speed and gap distributions, map raw-versus-cleaned samples, perturb stop parameters, reconcile trip and OD counts, and audit disclosure risk.
- **Failure modes:** suppress or qualify results for timezone ambiguity, long gaps, implausible speeds, poor network matching, sparse sampling, or re-identification risk.
- **Deliverables:** cleaned trajectories or approved aggregates, segmentation rules, quality report, derived stop/trip tables, privacy treatment, maps, and limitations.
- **Source freshness:** consult [the authoritative source registry](references/authoritative-sources.md) before using format, library, or privacy guidance and record the checked date.
