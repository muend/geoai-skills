  Engineering standards for implementing, reviewing, testing, and shipping
  code produced during geospatial and GeoAI work: Python quality, dependency
  control, cross-platform paths, CI/CD, automation, and reproducibility. Use
  when a spatial workflow includes scripts, packages, tests, deployment, or
  repository changes, especially when the user requests production readiness.
  Do not trigger for unrelated general software work or for analysis requests
  that require no code or repository artifact.

# Geospatial SWE & DevOps Standards

Purpose: code produced as part of geospatial work should run in the user's
real environment and meet peer-level engineering quality. Apply these rules
only when code or repository artifacts are in scope.

## 1. Environment realities (the top error source)

- **Script-first by default**: no `%matplotlib inline`, `!pip install`, or
  `display()` unless the user is explicitly in a notebook. Every file runs
  from a terminal via `python script.py` behind an
  `if __name__ == "__main__":` block. (Cell markers like `# %%` are fine
  as an addition — the script must also work without them.)
- **Cross-platform paths**: always `pathlib.Path`; never string-concatenate
  or hardcode `/` or `\\`. Ask or detect the user's OS before giving shell
  commands; give CMD/PowerShell syntax on Windows, POSIX elsewhere —
  don't mix (`export` vs `set`, `venv/bin/activate` vs
  `venv\Scripts\activate`).
- **Encodings**: explicit `encoding="utf-8"` on every text file open —
  Windows still defaults to legacy code pages, and non-ASCII content
  corrupts silently.
- **Modern Python (3.11+)**: `X | None` unions, `type` aliases, structural
  pattern matching where they clarify; state the minimum version if a
  feature requires it.

## 2. Code quality defaults

Applied to every generated function/module, even when not asked:

```python
def compute_share(values: list[float], total: float) -> list[float]:
    """Return each value's share of the total.

    Args:
        values: Values to compute shares for.
        total: Denominator; must be non-zero.

    Returns:
        Shares in the same order as values.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If total is zero.
    """
    if total == 0:
        raise ValueError("total must be non-zero — share is undefined.")
    return [v / total for v in values]
```

- Type hints on every signature; `dataclass`/`TypeAlias` for complex types.
- Google-style docstrings; one-liners suffice for trivial functions.
- **Never bare `except:`**; catch specific exceptions, handle or re-raise
  with `raise ... from e`. A silent `pass` costs a week of debugging.
- `logging` over `print` (leveled, formatted), except user-facing CLI
  output.
- Note algorithmic complexity where it matters ("this is O(n log n), safe
  at n>10⁶") — especially around nested loops and pandas `apply`.
- Magic numbers → named module-level constants.

## 3. Testing and verification

- Offer at least a skeleton pytest for every function carrying real logic:

```python
# test_compute.py — run: python -m pytest -q
import pytest
from compute import compute_share

def test_basic() -> None:
    assert compute_share([1, 1], 2) == [0.5, 0.5]

def test_zero_total_raises() -> None:
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        compute_share([1.0], 0)
```

- Numerical code: test edge cases — empty input, NaN, negatives, single
  element.
- Run generated code yourself when an execution environment exists;
  otherwise mark it explicitly "not executed" — no silent assumptions.

## 4. Dependencies and reproducibility

- New project → virtual environment + pinned `requirements.txt`
  (`package==version`); never "install the latest".
- Seed randomness and put the seed in config (details in
  `ml-experiment-standards`).
- Note environment-difference risks where relevant (BLAS, CUDA, locale).

## 5. Git practices

- Conventional Commits: `feat(scope): ...`, `fix: ...`, `refactor: ...`;
  the body explains *why* — the diff already shows *what*.
- Commit in meaningful units; warn against 500-line single commits.
- Default `.gitignore`: `venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, large data files
  (suggest DVC/LFS), IDE folders.

## 6. Automation / DevOps

- **CI**: minimal GitHub Actions for test + lint (ruff); note OS-runner
  differences if jobs must run on Windows too.
- **Docker**: start from `python:3.12-slim`, simple single-stage until
  size/caching demands more; note image size and build-cache implications.
- **Monitoring**: any long-lived service/pipeline ships three signals
  minimum: structured logs, failure alerting, basic metrics (duration,
  volume). ML services add drift checks (see `ml-experiment-standards`).
- **Scheduled jobs**: match the user's platform — cron on POSIX,
  Task Scheduler (`schtasks`) on Windows.

## 7. Code review mode

Review in this order and report findings by severity: correctness (edge
cases, silent failures) → security (injection, secrets, path traversal) →
performance (N+1, needless copies, O(n²)) → readability. Every finding
ships with the suggested fix as code — never "this is bad" and nothing
else.

## Execution contract

- **Workflow:** clarify the geospatial code's contract; reproduce the environment; inspect correctness and data invariants; implement the smallest safe change; test; package; document operations and rollback.
- **Decision rules:** apply this skill to geospatial software and pipeline delivery, not generic non-spatial coding; scale CI, containers, and observability to the actual deployment risk.
- **Verification protocol:** run focused and regression tests, lint and type checks where configured, exercise CRS/nodata/geometry edge cases, verify clean installation, and review CI artifacts.
- **Failure modes:** block release for silent data loss, nondeterminism, mutable hidden state, unpinned critical dependencies, secrets, platform assumptions, missing rollback, or unhandled spatial edge cases.
- **Deliverables:** reviewed code, tests, reproducible environment and lock data, CI configuration, operational notes, risk-ranked findings, observability plan, and rollback instructions.
- **Source freshness:** consult [the authoritative source registry](references/authoritative-sources.md) before applying packaging, CI, testing, or supply-chain guidance.
