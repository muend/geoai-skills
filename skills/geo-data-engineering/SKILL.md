# Geospatial Data Engineering

Purpose: get spatial data into a clean, validated, analysis-ready state with
a repeatable pipeline — the stage where most real-world GIS time is spent
and most silent errors are born.

## Format selection

| Format | Use for | Avoid because |
|---|---|---|
| **GeoParquet** | Analysis interchange, big vector, columnar workflows | Not yet readable by some legacy desktop GIS |
| **GeoPackage** | Desktop GIS exchange, multi-layer projects | Slower than Parquet at scale; SQLite locking |
| **FlatGeobuf** | Streaming, HTTP range reads | Single layer |
| **COG** (Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF) | All raster deliverables | — (make every GeoTIFF a COG) |
| **Zarr/NetCDF** | Multi-dimensional (time × band × y × x) | Overkill for single rasters |
| Shapefile | Only when a legacy tool demands it | 10-char columns, 2 GB cap, encoding chaos, multi-file fragility |
| CSV + WKT/lon-lat | Simple point exchange | No CRS metadata — document it explicitly |

## Acquisition playbook

- **OpenStreetMap**: small areas → `osmnx`; large extracts → Geofabrik PBF +
  `pyrosm`/`osmium`. Respect tag heterogeneity: always inspect tag value
  distributions before filtering.
- **Buildings/places at scale**: Overture Maps (GeoParquet on S3/Azure,
  query with DuckDB spatial — often the fastest path).
- **Satellite/raster**: STAC APIs via `pystac-client` + `odc-stac` — see
  `remote-sensing-analysis`; planetary archives → `google-earth-engine`.
- **Boundaries**: authoritative national source first; Natural Earth / GADM /
  geoBoundaries for global work — record which, versions differ materially.
- Record every acquisition: source URL, query parameters, retrieval date,
  license. Put it in a `DATA_SOURCES.md` next to the data.

## CRS engineering

- Store in EPSG:4326 or source CRS; **analyze** in a projected CRS suited to
  the extent: local UTM zone (`gdf.estimate_utm_crs()`), national grid, or
  equal-area (EPSG:6933/Mollweide) for cross-region area stats.
- Datum shifts matter at sub-meter precision: transformations between datums
  need the right transformation grid (`pyproj.network.set_network_enabled(True)`
  when accuracy matters).
- Never strip or overwrite a CRS to "fix" misaligned layers — diagnose which
  layer is wrong with a known landmark instead.

## Cleaning pipeline

Run `scripts/clean_vector.py` (or import its `clean_vector()` function) as
the standard hygiene pass: drops empty/null geometries, repairs invalid ones
with `make_valid`, de-duplicates, reprojects, and **prints an accounting
report** so silent data loss is impossible.

Then: normalize text attributes (trim, collapse whitespace, locale-aware
casefold — beware Turkish İ/ı, German ß), coerce dtypes explicitly, and show
`value_counts()` of every categorical you will later filter on.

## Scale strategies

- **Fits in RAM**: GeoPandas + Shapely 2 vectorized ops. Ensure the spatial
  index is used (`sjoin`, `query_bulk`) — hand-rolled loops are O(n²).
- **Bigger than RAM, single machine**: DuckDB `spatial` extension over
  GeoParquet (predicate pushdown + spatial SQL), or `dask-geopandas`.
- **Served / concurrent / transactional**: PostGIS — see `postgis-spatial-sql`.
- Rasters: windowed reads (`rasterio.windows`), chunked xarray + dask;
  never `read()` a 50 GB mosaic into memory.

## Pipeline standards

- Idempotent steps with explicit inputs/outputs on disk; re-running never
  corrupts state.
- Checkpoint after expensive stages (download, big join) in GeoParquet/GPKG.
- Log an accounting line per stage: rows/features/pixels in → out.
- Deterministic ordering before writing (sort by stable key) so diffs are
  meaningful.

## Pitfalls checklist

- CSV opened without declaring lon/lat columns' CRS.
- Shapefile column names silently truncated on export.
- Encoding mojibake from legacy files (try `encoding="utf-8"` then cp1252).
- Mixed geometry types in one layer (Polygon + MultiPolygon breaks some
  tools — normalize with `.explode()` or promote to Multi*).
- Antimeridian and pole-crossing geometries after naive reprojection.
- Downloaded "latest" data with no recorded version/date — unreproducible.

## Execution contract

- **Workflow:** inventory sources and contracts; acquire with provenance; inspect CRS, schema, geometry, and scale; clean deterministically; validate; write an analysis-ready artifact.
- **Decision rules:** select formats and engines from size, geometry, concurrency, and downstream access needs; never infer CRS or destructive repairs silently.
- **Verification protocol:** reconcile feature or pixel counts at every stage, assert CRS and geometry invariants, sample outputs spatially, and rerun to confirm idempotence.
- **Failure modes:** quarantine ambiguous CRS, mixed units, invalid encodings, lossy format conversions, or unexplained row loss instead of guessing.
- **Deliverables:** validated dataset, machine-readable schema and CRS, provenance manifest, accounting log, rejected-record report, and reproducible pipeline.
- **Source freshness:** consult [the authoritative source registry](references/authoritative-sources.md) before using version-sensitive formats or APIs and record the checked date.
